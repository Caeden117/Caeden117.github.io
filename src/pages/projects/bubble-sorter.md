# Development Story and Goals

Global Game Jam 2025 presented an exciting opportunity to start the new year with a collaborative creative project. The theme was *Bubbles*, and our team was determined to create something unique within the traditional 48-hour time constraint.

Bubble Sorter emerged from our brainstorming sessions as a puzzle-strategy game focused on conveyor belt mechanics and sorting algorithms. This was born from our enjoyment of factory games like Factorio and Satisfactory. The core concept revolves around sorting increasingly complex conveyor belts of times, and making sure each item is output in the correct order.

Our goal was to create an accessible yet challenging game that would introduce players to computational thinking concepts through engaging gameplay mechanics, all while maintaining the rapid development pace required for a successful game jam submission.

**Primary Technologies:**
- **Godot Engine** - Chosen for its excellent 2D capabilities and rapid prototyping features
- **GDScript** - Godot's Python-like scripting language for quick iteration
- **Git** - Version control for team collaboration during the jam
- **Aseprite** - Pixel art creation for game assets and animations

**Game Systems Developed:**
- **Conveyor Belt Mechanics** - Physics-based object movement and interaction
- **Progressive Difficulty System** - Gradually increasing complexity and map elements to maintain engagement
- **Dialog System** - Effective dialog system to communicate game mechanics to the player.

**Rationale Behind Technology Choices:**
Godot was selected for its user-friendly interface and excellent 2D game development tools. The engine's node-based architecture allowed for rapid prototyping and easy collaboration among team members with varying levels of experience. GDScript's Python-like syntax enabled quick implementation of game logic without the complexity of more verbose languages. Given my personal inexperience with Godot, this was also a brilliant opportunity to learn a new game engine.

# Technical Challenges and Solutions

**Physics and Conveyor Mechanics:**
- **Object Collision Detection** - Implementing reliable physics for moving objects on conveyor belts
- **Performance Optimization** - Ensuring smooth gameplay with multiple moving objects
- **Visual Clarity** - Keeping items visually separate from map elements
- **Input Responsiveness** - Creating intuitive controls for manipulating conveyor systems

**Game Design Challenges:**
- **Difficulty Curve** - Balancing accessibility for newcomers with challenge for experienced players
- **Visual Feedback** - Providing clear indicators for successful and failed conveyor sorting
- **Tutorial Integration** - Teaching game mechanics in a diagetic, in-universe manner

**Team Collaboration:**
- **Asset Pipeline** - Coordinating art creation and integration during time constraints
- **Feature Integration** - Merging different team members' work without conflicts
- **Playtesting Coordination** - Gathering and implementing feedback during development
- **Scope Management** - Maintaining realistic feature goals within jam timeframe

# Lessons Learned and Development Insights

**Game Jam Efficiency:**
Participating in Global Game Jam 2025 reinforced the importance of rapid decision-making and feature prioritization. The tight timeframe forced our team to focus on core mechanics first, then add polish and additional features as time permitted.

**Technical Skills Development:**
- Advanced understanding of Godot as a game engine
- Experience with implementing game mechanics and visual feedback systems
- Improved collaborative development workflows and asset integration
- Better understanding of Godot design principles under time pressure

**Team Dynamics:**
- Effective task delegation based on individual strengths and interests
- Communication strategies for rapid iteration and feedback cycles
- Problem-solving approaches for technical challenges under pressure
- Coordination techniques for parallel development across multiple systems

# Project Impact and Community Reception

**Learning Outcomes:**
The experience of developing Bubble Sorter within the Global Game Jam timeframe provided valuable insights into rapid game development, team coordination, and the importance of focusing on core gameplay mechanics. The project serves as a testament to what can be accomplished with focused effort and effective collaboration.

**Future Applications:**
The sorting conveyor belt systems developed for Bubble Sorter have potential applications in educational games and puzzle game development. The technical solutions and team coordination strategies established during this jam continue to influence subsequent collaborative projects.
