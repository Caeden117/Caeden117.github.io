# Development Story and Goals

Game jams were always something I felt a little intimidated by. With a short amount of time, you are expected to create a complete game with a gameplay loop, passable visuals and audio, playable, and bug free. And most of all, going through the motions of game development within such a short time can get very stressful!

My friends Auros and Bobbie invited me to join them in the 52nd Ludum Dare game jam. They are great friends of mine, and we collaborated on smaller projects in the past, so I figured the game jam would be more enjoyable.

With our team of 3, we set out to create a game jam entry following the theme of *harvest*. Admittedly, we were kinda stumped on what games to create that weren't farming simulators, so we instead tried to spruce things up with a unique setting and a basic story.

In Lunaculture, you play as Dr. Mamon, tasked to plant and sustain crops for the newly established colony on the moon of Iridium. With weekly quotas to meet, you are slowly given more variety of plants to help satisfy the colony.

# Technology Stack and Development Approach

**Primary Technologies:**
- **Unity** - Game engine chosen for rapid prototyping and 3D capabilities
- **C#** - Programming language for game systems and mechanics
- **Git** - Version control for team collaboration
- **Blender** - 3D modeling for lunar environment and agricultural structures

**Game Systems Developed:**
- **Grid-based Farming System** - Tile-based planting and harvesting mechanics
- **Weekly Objective System** - Quota-based progression with escalating difficulty
- **Resource Management** - Currency and inventory systems for sustainable gameplay

**Rationale Behind Technology Choices:**
Unity was the natural choice given our team's familiarity and the engine's excellent support for rapid iteration. The grid-based approach allowed us to create a structured farming system that was both intuitive for players and manageable to implement within our time constraints. Our focus on modular systems enabled parallel development across team members.

# Technical Challenges and Learning Experiences

**First-Time Game Jam Constraints:**
Having not participated in any game jam, I had to learn time management and setting proper expectations for such a short deadline. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at things, I was not alone. My friends also had no experience in game jams!

**Scope Management Challenges:**
We needed to learn how to properly scope out features in a game jam entry, and fast. With only 3 days to create our game, shortened by human needs like eating and sleeping, we very quickly needed to cut features in the name of time. Features like oxygen and water management, saving and loading, and even audio (yikes!) had to be scrapped in order to submit the game on time.

**Technical Implementation Hurdles:**
- **UI/UX Design** - Creating intuitive interfaces for farming mechanics under time pressure
- **Game Balance** - Tuning difficulty progression and resource management
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Making sure the game worked across different devices and the web

# Lessons Learned and Development Growth

**Project Management Skills:**
Lunaculture was a huge learning experience as a project. From time management, project management, and small team collaboration, I learned a ton about working with strict deadlines and in game development scenarios. A lot of people say that game jams are a great way to learn the game development process and how development works in a professional workplace. And after participating in a game jam myself, I am inclined to agree!

**Technical Skills Development:**
- Rapid prototyping techniques for game mechanics
- Effective use of Unity's built-in systems for quick implementation
- Code organization strategies for collaborative development
- Feature prioritization and scope management under pressure

**Team Collaboration Insights:**
- Asynchronous development workflows for small teams
- Effective communication strategies during crunch periods
- Task delegation based on individual strengths and preferences
- Conflict resolution and decision-making under time constraints

# Project Impact and Jam Results

The results of our game jam entry was a solid "alright" for our first game jam project. Out of 1692 submissions to Ludum Dare 52, Lunaculture placed an overall 357th, or about the top 21%. Our team was more than happy with this score!

**Jam Results:**
- **357th Overall** out of 1692 submissions (Top 21%)
- **213th in Theme** showing our accuracy to the "harvest" theme

**Legacy and Future Impact:**
From Lunaculture, we took our learned lessons and applied them to the next Ludum Dare, bringing on more of our friends as well. To see how our second game jam venture went, check out Liver Die!

The success of Lunaculture established our team's credibility in the game jam community and provided the foundation for more ambitious collaborative projects. The farming mechanics and grid-based systems developed for this project influenced design decisions in subsequent games.
