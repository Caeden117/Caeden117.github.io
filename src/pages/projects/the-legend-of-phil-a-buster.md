# Development Story and Goals

[IMAGE STUB: Screenshot of main gameplay showing deckbuilding interface with mad-lib text generation in progress]

I was fortunate enough to participate in the second Tri-Campus Game Jam hosted by the University of Washington. This jam presented an exciting challenge: create an innovative game that would showcase our team's creativity and technical skills within the academic game development community. The theme of *delay the inevitable* and constraints of the jam pushed us to explore unusual game mechanics and narrative approaches.

The Legend of Phil A. Buster emerged from our desire to combine two seemingly incompatible concepts: the strategic depth of deckbuilding games and the linguistic creativity of mad-lib. We envisioned a roguelike experience where players build their deck while comedically filibusting Congress through wacky, nonsensical sentences.

Our goal was to create a game that would surprise players with its unique approach to familiar genres while demonstrating innovative design thinking and technical execution within the jam's timeframe.

# Technology Stack and Innovation Focus

**Primary Technologies:**
- **Godot Engine** - Chosen for its flexible node system and rapid prototyping capabilities
- **GDScript** - Godot's scripting language for complex game logic implementation
- **Git** - Version control for coordinated team development

**Innovative Systems Developed:**
- **Dynamic Mad-Lib Engine** - Real-time story generation based on player choices and card selections
- **Deckbuilding Framework** - Card acquisition, deck management, and strategic play mechanics
- **Narrative-Mechanical Integration** - System where gameplay choices directly affect story outcomes
- **Procedural Content Generation** - Roguelike elements with story-appropriate random events

**Rationale Behind Technology Choices:**
Godot's flexible architecture made it ideal for experimenting with novel game mechanics that don't fit traditional genre templates. The engine's scene system allowed us to create modular components that could be combined in unexpected ways, supporting our experimental approach to game design.
