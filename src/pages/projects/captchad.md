# Development Story and Goals

UHackathon 2025 presented a unique opportunity to combine humor with technology in a competitive hackathon environment. The challenge was to create something that would stand out among the numerous projects within a super constrained 6 hour timeframe.

Envisioning a game for the Fun track, Captcha'd emerged from our observation of the universal frustration with CAPTCHA systems combined with the fast-paced, chaotic energy of WarioWare-style mini-games. We envisioned a game that would turn the mundane task of proving you're human into an entertaining, high-energy experience.

Our goal was to create a satirical take on modern internet security measures while providing genuinely engaging gameplay that would keep players coming back for more challenges and higher scores.

**Primary Technologies:**
- **Godot Engine** - Selected for rapid prototyping and excellent 2D game development tools
- **GDScript** - Godot's scripting language for quick implementation of game logic
- **Git** - Version control for team coordination during the hackathon

**Game Systems Implemented:**
- **Microgame Framework** - Modular system for different CAPTCHA-style challenges
- **Scoring and Progression** - Points-based system with increasing difficulty
- **Timer Management** - Time pressure by decreasing allotted challenge time with difficulty
- **Input Variety** - Multiple input methods to simulate different CAPTCHA types

**Rationale Behind Technology Choices:**
Godot was chosen for its exceptional rapid development capabilities and built-in tools that allowed us to iterate quickly during the hackathon timeframe. The engine's node system made it easy to create microgames that could be developed in parallel by team members.

# Technical Challenges and Creative Solutions

**Microgames:**
- **Challenge Diversification** - Creating multiple distinct gameplay mechanics within time constraints
- **Difficulty Scaling** - Implementing progressive difficulty that maintains engagement
- **Input Responsiveness** - Ensuring precise controls across different challenge types
- **Visual Clarity** - Making chaotic gameplay understandable and fair

**Hackathon-Specific Challenges:**
- **Time Management** - Balancing feature development with polish in hyper-compressed timeframe
- **Scope Control** - Maintaining focus on core loop while avoiding feature creep
- **Asset Creation** - Developing visual assets rapidly without sacrificing quality
- **Integration Coordination** - Simultaneously working on microgames and the core game loop via a shared interface

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Game Management** - Creating smooth transitions between microgames
- **User Interface** - Designing intuitive controls for various microgame types
- **Expandable Gameplay** - Designing a system that easily allows for future microgames

# Lessons Learned and Hackathon Experience

**Rapid Development Insights:**
Participating in UHackathon 2025 reinforced the importance of clear communication and rapid decision-making in competitive development environments. The time pressure forced us to prioritize core features and find creative shortcuts without compromising the player experience.

**Creative Problem Solving:**
- Leveraging existing game design patterns (WarioWare) for rapid development
- Finding humor in everyday technology frustrations as a design inspiration
- Balancing satirical elements with genuinely engaging gameplay mechanics
- Creating variety within a constrained theme and timeframe

**Technical Skills Development:**
- Advanced proficiency with Godot's rapid development features
- Experience with modular game architecture for hackathon environments
- Better coordination of parallel development across multiple systems

# Project Impact and Competition Results

**Hackathon Performance:**
Captcha'd successfully won the fun track in UHackathon 2025. Our team was rewarded with tote bags filled with merchandise from the University of Washington.
