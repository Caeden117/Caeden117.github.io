# Development Story and Goals

ChroMapper began in February 2019 as a collaborative project between myself and a friend, born from frustration with the existing Beat Saber map editors. The community tools at the time suffered from usability issues and performance limitations that hindered the creative process for mappers. We envisioned creating a superior editor that would not only address these shortcomings but also incorporate cutting-edge features emerging from Beat Saber's vibrant modding community.

The project started as a simple improvement effort but evolved into something far more ambitiousâ€”a comprehensive mapping ecosystem that would become the cornerstone of Beat Saber map creation.

# Technology Stack and Architecture

**Primary Technologies:**
- **Unity** - Chosen to match Beat Saber's engine for maximum compatibility
- **C#** - Leveraging our existing expertise and Unity's native language
- **Jenkins CI/CD** - Automated builds and distribution pipeline

**Rationale Behind Technology Choices:**
Unity was the natural choice given Beat Saber's foundation and our team's familiarity with the engine. C# provided robust performance for real-time editing operations while maintaining flexibility for our growing open-source community. The decision to implement a comprehensive plugin system using .NET Framework enabled community extensibility without compromising core stability.

# Technical Challenges and Solutions

## Performance Optimization Journey
The most significant challenge was achieving real-time performance with complex beatmaps. Early iterations struggled with:
- Object rendering bottlenecks when handling thousands of objects
- Inefficient mouse raycasting causing editor lag
- Memory management issues during extended editing sessions

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Developed custom object pooling systems for rendering
- Implemented spatial partitioning for optimized raycasting
- Fixed many inefficient code paths with better designed, memory and runtime efficient versions

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
Expanding ChroMapper's reach required addressing platform-specific challenges:
- Achieved compatibility with Chromebooks, Steam Deck, and Android devices
- Implemented platform-agnostic input systems
- Developed universal build pipeline supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Codebase Management
As the project grew from a weekend experiment to a multi-year endeavor, maintaining code quality became crucial:
- Established coding conventions with `.editorconfig` enforcement
- Implemented a testing suite that is run through Jenkins
- Created plugin architecture enabling community contributions without core modifications
