						<p>My life as a programmer began very young, when my dad introduced me to Kodu Game Lab. The visual programming interface helped me grasp basic concepts, and the 3D level editor let me create whatever I wanted. It was a really creative tool to help kids learn to program!</p>
						<p>I have contributed to many projects over the years, both personal and professional. I've created level editors, games, and various tools that people use on the regular. These projects allowed me to gain valuable experience and growth as a developer.</p>
						<p>And so that journey leads me to the University of Washington. I'm fortunate enough to be studying Computer Science with very talented peers and professors. I now serve as president of Husky Game Development, a club for game development and design.</p>
						<p>This website is my portfolio and reflects my development journey. I hope you find it informative and engaging!</p>

				<p>Hi! Welcome to my new website.</p>
				<p>My previous website had been in use since 2020, and while it served me well, I needed a fresh start.<br>It was built using raw HTML and CSS, which was really restrictive. Furthermore, adding new projects was a pain.</p>
				<p>This new website is built using modern web technologies, and will allow me to easily showcase my work in a more efficient manner.</p>
				<p>Pardon the dust. Soon, you'll see this website populated with projects old and new.</p>
