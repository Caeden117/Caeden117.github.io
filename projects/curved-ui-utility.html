		<h2>Goal and Explanation</h2>

			<div class="big-side">
				<p>
					I am a huge fan of the <i>Halo</i> franchise, and one of the effects I couldn't help but notice was how Bungie
					approached the HUD in their later entries.
					<br><br>
					In first person, your HUD was curved inwards. In third person, the HUD would dynamically flatten out to its
					true 2D appearance.
					<br><br>
					For some odd reason, I was really interested in this effect, and I always wondered how Bungie implemented this
					system. I decided to recreate this effect myself in Unity and C#.

					My early iteration of Curved UI Utility was slow. Pretty slow. This was because I was rendering the HUD twice
					on two separate canvases; once as a flat image, then another passed through a shader which did the curving.
					<br><br>
					I later scrapped this iteration and started anew. Because Curved UI Utility was going to operate on each UI
					element every frame, I wanted this to be fast. Not only that, I also wanted the package to be easy for game
					developers to implement.

		<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
		<div class="horizontal centered">
			<div class="big-side">
				<p>
					Curved UI Utility isn't nearly as big of a project compared to ChroMapper or Hive, but it did give me a
					newfound respect for real-time code optimization, and how fast systems need to be to create high performance
					games.
					<br><br>
					Curved UI Utility also taught me the difference between parameters passed by-value and by-ref, and how I could
					take advantage of those to achieve fast code.
