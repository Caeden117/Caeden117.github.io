          <p>
            ChroMapper was created out of a need of an improved map editor for the Beat Saber community. At the time, the existing map editors had some areas of improvement that I wanted to rectify. This included general usability, and the lack of new features.
            <br><br>
            In February of 2019, a friend and I started work on ChroMapper. We chose Unity as our engine for a few reasons: First, it would match the engine used by Beat Saber, and second, it was the engine both of us were the most familiar in.

            Over the course of ChroMapper's development, I ran into multiple issues that turned into large learning experiences. I never knew how large the project would become, so I quickly learned the importance of organizing and maintaining code.
            <br><br>
            I quickly learned and applied object-oriented programming concepts, such as interfaces and abstract classes, to reuse as much common functionality as possible, while also allowing for slight variations in behavior.

			<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

        <div class="big-side">
          <p>
            ChroMapper is easily the largest project I've worked on, and the challenges I faced certainly morphed me into a much better developer.
            <br><br>
            While project structure and maintainence were big lessons I learned, the best lessons that come out of developing ChroMapper were in the optimization department. Multiple times in development, I had to sit down and rewrite systems that caused poor performance; from implementing object pools, to optimizing rendering performance, and even making my own simple (yet fast) raycast system.
