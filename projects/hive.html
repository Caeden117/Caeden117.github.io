        Hive is a game-agnostic, back-end framework for modding communities of all shapes and sizes.
        <br><br>
        This was contract work between myself and other amazing developers in the Beat Saber modded community.

          <p>
            Hive started as the replacement for our previous mod repository, which was rushed, infamously broken, and hacked together. At the beginning of 2020, a team of talented developers in the Beat Saber community (myself included) got together and started work on Hive.
            <br><br>
            While we were designing Hive to be a replacement for our old Beat Saber mod repository, a key pillar we had was to design Hive to be game-agnostic, barebones, and generic; any mod community can setup an instance of Hive and expand on it to meet their exact needs.

			<h2>Stack and Explanation</h2>

      <h4>
        During initial planning, we discussed various languages and back-end solutions to use for Hive. In the end, we decided on ASP.NET Core and C#, as that was the language we all collectively knew. This was right around the corner of .NET 5, so we also wanted to take the opportunity to embrace new features brought by .NET 5 and C# 9.
        <br><br>
        We also decided to take a hybrid GraphQL and RESTful approach to the API; the REST interface provided the basic functionality for Hive, while GraphQL would simplify advanced queries.

            This was my first big group project done with other talented developers. I learned to use Git in a team environment, take/give feedback in Pull Request reviews, and conform my code to strict quality and convention guidelines.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, this was also my first time ever touching ASP.NET; I essentially dived into this project completely blind. My existing C# experience (especially from previous projects) did help a lot, but a lot of ASP.NET was learned from hands-on experience. I caught on pretty quickly, especially on the RESTful side of the API.

            Hive is definitely the project I am the most proud of. I am extremely grateful to have taken the opportunity to work on it, and with other talented developers in the Beat Saber community.
            <br><br>
            The biggest learning experience for me was learning all about ASP.NET Core and back-end development - all while I was working on it.
            <br><br>
            Developing Hive has also taught me alot when it comes to writing quality code, mostly thanks to the extreme quality guidelines.
