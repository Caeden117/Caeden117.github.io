				<p>
					Hive started as the replacement for our previous mod repository,
					<a href="https://beatmods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">BeatMods</a>.
					BeatMods was rushed, infamously broken, and was hacked together in a weekend as an emergency. At the
					beginning
					of 2020, a team of talented developers in the Beat Saber community (myself included) decided enough
					was
					enough, got together, and started work on what would become Hive.
					<br><br>
					While we were designing Hive to be a replacement for our old Beat Saber mod repository, a key pillar
					we had
					was to design Hive to be game-agnostic, barebones, and generic; any mod community can setup an
					instance of
					Hive and expand it to meet their exact needs.

		<h2>Stack and Explanation</h2>

		<h4>
			During initial planning, we decided to use ASP.NET Core and C# because of our collective experience with the
			language. This was right around the corner of .NET 5, so we also wanted to take the opportunity to embrace
			new
			features brought by .NET 5 and C# 9.
			<br><br>
			We also decided to take a hybrid GraphQL and RESTful approach to the API; the REST interface provided the
			basic
			functionality for Hive, while GraphQL would simplify more advanced queries.
			<br><br>
			Interestingly, we decided to not bundle a front-end with core Hive. Considering instances of Hive would look
			very
			different depending on the instance maintainer, we instead decided to create one front-end for our complete,
			Beat
			Saber specific Hive instance as an "example" for other communities.

					This was my first big group project done with other talented developers. I learned to use Git in a
					team
					environment, give and address feedback in Pull Request reviews, be asked about the decisions I've
					made in my
					code, and conform that code to strict quality and convention guidelines.
					<br><br>
					Furthermore, this was also my first time ever touching ASP.NET; I essentially dived in completely
					blind.
					My previous C# experience did help, but a lot of ASP.NET was learned from hands-on experience, and
					turning to
					my fellow developers for help.

				<p>
					Hive is definitely the project I am the most proud of. I am extremely grateful to have taken the
					opportunity
					to work on it, and with other talented developers in the Beat Saber community.
					<br><br>
					The biggest learning experience for me was learning all about ASP.NET Core and back-end development
					- all
					while I was working on it.
					<br><br>
					Developing Hive has also taught me alot when it comes to writing quality code, mostly thanks to the
					extreme
					quality guidelines.
